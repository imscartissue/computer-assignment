    <h1>Statistics</h1>

    <p>
        
        In statistics, the mean is a fundamental measure of central tendency that represents the average value of a set of numbers. It is calculated by summing up all the values in a dataset and then dividing this sum by the total number of values. The mean provides a single value that is indicative of the 'typical' value within the data. It is widely used in various fields, from science and economics to everyday life, as it offers a straightforward way to understand and compare different sets of data. Despite its simplicity, the mean can be sensitive to extreme values, commonly known as outliers, which can significantly skew its value, making it important to consider the distribution and characteristics of the data before drawing conclusions based solely on this measure of central tendency.
